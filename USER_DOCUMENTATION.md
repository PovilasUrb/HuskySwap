# HuskySwap User Documentation

## 1. Getting Started
### 1.1 Why use HuskySwap?
Ever had a bad day waking up at 5 am for course registration just to know that the classes you wanted were already full? <br />
Are you never fast enough to get that spot after seeing that “...has seats available” notification pop up on your phone? <br />
Did you wanted to see if you could get a spot that someone was going to drop, but have NO friends to ask? <br />
HuskySwap is there to solve your problem!

### 1.2 What is HuskySwap?
Husky Swap is a public website where people can list and trade classes before and at the beginning of each quarter! <br />
The platform simplifies the course management by allowing students to communicate and swap seats in a class. <br />
HuskySwap aims to eliminate the uncertainty and inefficiency of the current course adjustment process by providing a platform for students to find and trade seats with others easily, giving a second chance on course registration process.


## 2. Does HuskySwap need setup?
- Since HuskySwap is a website, no additional setup or installation of external software is necessary.
